# Projects-CPP
Some short C++ projects put into one repo. 

# What is this all about?
So in this project I'm writing some C++ code for different puproses whilst trying to learn CMake 
by deliberately writing the code in various ways i.e. using forward declaration when 
it's not necessarily optimal just for the sake of dealing with it in CMake.

# Projects
the description is taken from here: [Link] (https://github.com/thekarangoel/Projects)

**Fibonacci Sequence** – Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.

**Prime Factorization** – Have the user enter a number and find all Prime Factors (if there are any) and display them.

**Next Prime Number** – Have the program find prime numbers until the user chooses to stop asking for the next one.

# Custom Projects

**Maze Generator** - Currently under development but the idea is to generate and solve mazes.

**CPP Mechanism** - Workshop focued on setting up a proper project in CMake and testing different C++ mechanisms.
